# Cursor AI Rules for Silni App

## Environment Safety
- NEVER modify `.env` to use production without explicit permission
- NEVER push to `main` branch directly
- ALWAYS use `develop` branch for development work
- ALWAYS use staging environment (dqqyhmydodjpqboykzow) for testing

## Branch Rules
- main = PRODUCTION (protected, PR only)
- develop = STAGING (safe to work on)
- feature/* = new features
- fix/* = bug fixes

## Before Any Production Action
Ask: "Has this been tested on staging?"

## Commands Reference
- Switch to staging: `./scripts/switch-env.sh staging`
- Switch to production: `./scripts/switch-env.sh production`
- Current branch: `git branch --show-current`

## Tech Stack
- Flutter/Dart for mobile app
- Supabase for backend (Auth, Database, Edge Functions)
- Next.js for admin dashboard (silni-admin/)
- Firebase for push notifications only
